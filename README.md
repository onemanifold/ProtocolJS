# ProtocolJS

ProtocolJS is a JavaScript-based Protocol Development Framework intended to emphasize formalization, interoperability, verifiability. This framework serves as a valuable resource for specifying, implementing, simulating and visualizing protocols. At its core, ProtocolJS boasts an extensible typing system that seamlessly handles the validation, serialization, and deserialization of messages exchanged between two protocol endpoints.

## Key Features

- **Protocol Development**: ProtocolJS is a protocol development framework written in JavaScript. It goes beyond just aiding in protocol implementation; it also facilitates simulation and visualization.

- **Flexible Modeling**: The framework excels in separating protocol grammar from its implementation. This separation empowers users to model a protocol instance, such as a connection or network, with varying degrees of detail. By structuring protocols in a layered fashion, ProtocolJS allows for the simulation and analysis of different aspects of the protocol, depending on your specific requirements.

- **Iterative Development**: Protocol development becomes an iterative process with ProtocolJS. This approach enables communication of a protocol's inner workings as early as possible and facilitates a gradual increase in complexity. This iterative approach ensures that your protocols are well-understood and can evolve organically.

## Future Goals

We envision a future where ProtocolJS extends its reach beyond JavaScript. Our goal is to port this framework to other virtual machines (VMs) and programming languages to enhance interoperability. Consisten with protocol development goals, we aim to facilitate seamless communication between diverse systems, regardless of the technology stack they use. Stay tuned for updates as we work towards achieving this vision.

## Usage

ProtocolJS's ease of use and versatility make it suitable for a wide range of applications:

- **Protocol Implementation**: Use ProtocolJS to implement your desired protocols efficiently.

- **Simulation**: Simulate protocol behavior to gain insights into performance, compatibility, and potential issues.

- **Visualization**: Visualize protocol interactions to aid in understanding and debugging.

- **Testability**: ProtocolJS places a strong emphasis on testability. It provides the tools and features necessary to thoroughly test your protocol implementations, helping you ensure robust and reliable communication.

- **Education**: ProtocolJS is an excellent educational tool for students and professionals interested in protocol development and network communication.
